                                    Hybrid zone is an automatic and strategic affiliate marketing based system where profits
                                    are generated when new or existing participants in the hybrid ecosystem purchase one or
                                    more of the digital product called zones. 100% of profits generated is distributed to
                                    participants of the system following the Entry, H4 and H6 profit formula. There are 11
                                    zones in this program hence providing members with 11 channels of income.

                                    H4 zones (zone 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and H6 zones (zone 3, 5, 7, 9, 11).

                                    Zones can only be purchased serially in an ascending order. For example, you cannot
